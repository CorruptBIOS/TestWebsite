        <dt>Burpee</dt>
        <dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.</dd>

        <dt>Plank</dt>
        <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get into a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.</dd>

        <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
        <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
